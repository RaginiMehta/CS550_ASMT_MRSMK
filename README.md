## Medical Report Summarisation using Medical Knowledge

This project leverages machine learning to enhance medical report summarization for radiologists, addressing the challenges of complex and high-volume medical images that can lead to inconsistent diagnoses and potential errors. By integrating medical knowledge into the summarization process, the project aims to reduce cognitive load and improve diagnostic accuracy, ultimately making medical image analysis more effective and reliable.
